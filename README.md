# JS-JQuery-Famous-Movie-Quote-Random-Gen
Famous Movie Quote Random Generator using Javascript and JQuery 

What is this?
The following is a script using 'javascript' that populates any text based html tag with a selection of 50 random popular movie quote upon the loading of an html document. The script operates in conjunction with JQuery so you must link the JQuery core with the <script src=""></script> tag like so:

 <!-- Linking JQuery Core -->  
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
 <!-------------------------->
 
 *You can just copy and paste the above snippet anywhere inside of the <html></html> tags into your html document*
 ------------------------------------------------------------

Why use this?
You use this to generate random popular movie quotes in order to keep users entertained, namely if you have an error screen such as a custom 404 page you can utilize this script
to spice things up and give a little fun to your code.

How do I install this?
First off, as mentioned previously you must link the JQuery core in your HTML document using the provided snippet above, this linkage doesn't have to be placed in the <head> section, just place it anywhere you'd like and make sure it's organized in line with your other code. Second, after downloading the script from the main .js file, you can simply place it in the root folder along with the rest of your html and other documents, then link the script anywhere you'd like, like so:
  
 <!-- Linking FMQRG.js Core -->    
<script src="FMQRG.js"></script>
 <!-------------------------->
 
  *You can just copy and paste the above snippet anywhere inside of the <html></html> tags into your html document*
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  How do I apply this?
  Now, after all of the setup is done, in order to utilize the script you attach the following id to any text based tag you're using <h1, <p1 etc:
  
  "id = "rnd-quote-data""
  ex.)
  h2 class = "ex-css" id = "rnd-quote-data">Sample text</h2
  
  Note: Complete the tags with either missing '<' or '>' 
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  And you're done!
